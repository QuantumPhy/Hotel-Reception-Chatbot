i have a little problem with room 507 .
what exactly seems to be the problem , mr . sandals ?
i found cockroaches in my room .
cockroaches , sir ? that is unbelievable .
i have seen at least nine different cockroaches in my room .
sir , are you sure you have not seen the same silverfish nine times ?
there are nine cockroaches in my room . i do not have time for your disbelief !
i apologize . one moment , please , while i transfer you to my supervisor .
i am in 507 . i have a few problems with my room .
what is that problem , sir ?
there are cockroaches in my room .
are you sure , sir ? flies i could believe , but cockroaches ?
i have counted nine different cockroaches , and i accidentally stepped on another one .
sir , we run a spotless and cockroach less hotel .
you dare to doubt me ?
i am sorry , sir . let me transfer you to my supervisor .
there is a big problem with my room . i am in 507 .
would you tell me the nature of the problem , sir ?
i have cockroaches crawling in my room .
perhaps you saw a silverfish , sir .
i have seen nine more cockroaches than i wanted to see .
sir , you have not been drinking by any chance , have you ?
how dare you question my statement !
forgive me . you are 100 percent correct . allow me to transfer you to my supervisor .
there is a major problem with room 507 .
i am sorry to hear that . please tell me the exact problem .
this room is overrun with cockroaches .
there has been an occasional silverfish in the hotel , sir .
i stopped counting at nine .
sir , this hotel just passed a thorough insect inspection with flying colors .
your inspector needs spectacles . the fact is that cockroaches are running rampant .
i apologize , sir . just a second , while i transfer you to my supervisor .
i am in 507 , and i have a big problem .
i am so sorry . kindly tell me what the problem is , sir .
everywhere i look , i see cockroaches .
perhaps you could look again , sir , to double check .
the next cockroach i see will be number ten .
mr . sandals , i have worked here five years without seeing one cockroach .
i have already suffered enough without listening anymore to you !
you are right , sir . please let me transfer you to my supervisor .
i have a little problem with room 507 .
problems are what we are here for , sir . please tell me your problem .
this room is filthy with cockroaches .
were you wearing your glasses when you noticed them , sir ?
i have already seen nine of them and , as they say , eight is enough !
sir , sometimes a fast elevator ride makes our guests see spots .
you are not in a position to question my vision or my statement !
i am very sorry , sir . will you please hold while i transfer you to my supervisor ?
i want to change rooms . in fact , i want a refund for tonight !
and the problem is , sir ?
cockroaches have taken over my room !
my apologies , sir . we will give you a new room and refund the value of your current room .
thank you . i want to continue to be able to recommend this hotel to others .
we always try to serve our guests in the most agreeable way possible .
i want to change rooms immediately , plus a refund for tonight .

i am knee deep in cockroaches !
i am so sorry , sir . we will give you a new room immediately , and give you a refund also .
thank you . i am glad that this hotel strives to keep its reputation intact .
sir , we always try to please our guests .
i am quite upset ! i want a new room and a refund for tonight .
forgive me , sir , i have not been told what the problem is .
i am about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches !
my apologies , sir . we will transfer you to a new room at once and give you a full refund .
thank you . i did not want to have to take this to court .
sir , we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy .
this room is unacceptable . i want a new one , and i want a refund for tonight .
would you please tell me the exact problem , sir ?
i am being attacked by hordes of cockroaches !
oh , my gosh , they are back ? another room at once , sir , plus a full refund , of course .
thank you very much . this has been a most unsettling experience .
sir , our guests are our reason for being .
this room is unfit for humans . i want another room , and i want a refund for tonight .
perhaps if you would be kind enough to tell me the problem , sir .
in a word , cockroaches !
oh , no , are they back ? i will give you another room immediately , sir , and a refund for tonight .
thank you . i am glad that you do not believe that your guests are liars .
sir , without happy guests , we are nothing .
i want to change rooms . in fact , i want a refund for tonight !
if you tell me the exact problem , i can be more helpful .
cockroaches have declared war on my room !
allow me to apologize . i will give you another room right now , and a full refund for tonight .
thank you for not asking me to collect the roaches in a jar as evidence .
sir , only your mother wants to please you more than we do .

do i have to pay extra ?
no , sir . it is gratis . just take your room key so you can get in .
what are the gym hours ?
you will be happy to know that it is open 24/7 .
great ! is a trainer available ?
i am sorry , but no . we used to have a trainer , but then he had an unfortunate accident .
does this hotel have an exercise facility ?
but of course ! we have a great exercise facility .
good . now exactly where is it ?
it is located right under our lobby . just take the elevator or the stairs one flight down .
is this going to cost me anything ?
no , sir . the gym is absolutely free . however , be sure to take your room key with you .
when does the gym open and close ?
the hours could not be better , 24/7 .
very good . now , is there a trainer down there ?
i wish i could tell you yes , but no , there is not .
do you have a place where i can exercise ?
yes , sir . we have a fine exercise facility .
i am happy to hear that . now , would you tell me where it is ?
you are actually standing above it . just take the elevator or stairs down one level .
is the hotel going to charge me a dollar a minute for gym use ?
no , sir . there is no extra charge . all you need is your room key to open the door .
and the gym hours are ?
sir , you will be pleased to know that our gym never closes .
one more question
do you have a trainer ?
we might be getting one in the near future . but at the present time , no .
excuse me . do you happen to have a gym here ?
yes , sir . i think you will find our gym quite satisfactory .
so , where do i go to exercise ?
it is only one flight down , sir . just take the elevator or the stairs .
am i going to be charged extra for using the gym ?
sir , you can use the gym for free . all you need is your room key .
great ! now tell me , what are the hours of this gym ?
sir , our gym is open around the clock , every day of the week .
do you have a trainer to help me work out ?
i am sorry , sir , but we have no trainer .
i had like to request some more amenities .
amenities ? what do you mean by amenities , sir ?
the free stuff , you know , the soap , lotion , shampoo , etc .
i see . sir , if i may ask
have you used up all the amenities in your room ?
not at all . i still have enough for the next few days .
then what is the problem , sir ?
i need some to keep as souvenirs !
souvenirs ?
yes , souvenirs . trinkets to remember my trip by !
we do have a souvenir shop on the first floor , sir .
that is not the same . i never pay for hotel souvenirs !
i will call housekeeping . someone will be up with more amenities shortly .
i need more amenities , please .
could you be a little more specific , sir ?
to be more specific , the free stuff , like soap , lotion , and shampoo .
i understand . now , you are saying that you have already used up all your amenities ?
no ! i have got all i need for my stay here .
so , what is the problem ?
i need souvenirs !
you want some souvenirs !
yes , yes . souvenirs .
but , sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items .
that is not the same thing . if you buy hotel souvenirs , they have no sentimental value .
i understand , sir . i will call housekeeping . you will have your souvenirs shortly .
how do i get more amenities ?
i am sorry , sir . i am not sure i understand .
i am talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo .
oh , i see . so , you are saying that you have already run out of your amenities .
no , no . i have got plenty left .
now i am confused again ! what is the problem ?
what am i going to do about souvenirs ?
oh , i get it ! you want souvenirs !
yes , i have got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs .
sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount .
please ! free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs .
i understand completely , sir . housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment .
yes , i need more amenities .
by amenities , exactly what do you mean , please ?
you know , the things that are free , like the soap and the shampoo .
okay , i got it . you have already run out of all your amenities ?
no , i still have plenty left , even if i took three baths a day .
i am more confused now than before . how is there a problem ?
i need to take home some souvenirs !
okay , finally i understand . you would like souvenirs !
yes , souvenirs that i can take home and add to my collection .
if it is souvenirs you want , sir , just visit our souvenir shop . it has everything .
are you kidding ? whoever heard of paying for hotel souvenirs ?
no problem at all , sir . housekeeping will deliver you all the amenities you like in a bit .
i need some more amenities , please .
i am not sure i am following you , sir .
specifically , i am talking about the little things , like soap and shampoo .
oh , now i understand ! so , you have already used up all your amenities ?
no , i am not even halfway through my supply .
i am losing you , sir . what is the problem ?
what is the use of going to a hotel if you do not take home souvenirs ?
okay , i got it . you are collecting souvenirs !
there you go . my friends expect me to bring home souvenirs .
have you visited our souvenir shop , sir ? it is loaded with all kinds of items .
i have never paid for a hotel souvenir in my life , and i do not intend to start now .
sir , housekeeping will bring you a basketful of amenities momentarily .
i need to copy a document immediately .
we have a copy machine in our computer lab , located on the first floor .

there is a copy machine on the first floor in our computer lab , sir .

i am only making one copy , so i guess i can afford it .
a dime is still a bargain , sir .
i need to make a copy of a document as soon as possible .
no problem , sir . there is a copy machine in our computer lab .
very good . how much does each copy cost ?
each copy will cost you a dime , sir .
a dime ? i remember when copies used to cost a nickel .
there are not many things you can get for a nickel , sir .
i need a doctor immediately !
sir , is everything all right ?
my wife just collapsed on the floor !

time is critical . hurry up !
i hope everything turns out well , sir . here is 911 .
i had like to order broadband internet for my laptop .
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer , and a prompt will tell you the payment options .
i do not have an ethernet port . my computer runs entirely on wireless service .
that is too bad . but there are several alternatives , if you want to hear them .
yes , please ! tell me about the alternatives .
we run a fully equipped computer lab on the first floor .
very good . how much does that cost ?
the service is free to hotel patrons . however , printing costs ten cents per page .
i see . and the other alternatives ?
alternatively , we do offer wireless in our lobby . you can bring your laptop down here .
great ! what if i need to print something in the lobby ?
you would have to use the computer lab . i am sorry for the inconvenience .
i need broadband for my computer .
no problem . just plug the ethernet cable into your computer , and you are good to go .
that is a problem . my laptop has no ethernet port , it is wireless only .
hmm . well , we have some alternatives , if you are interested .
go ahead . i am all ears .
we have a computer lab on the first floor .
that is great ! how much is it ?
it is absolutely free to guests . except for printing , of course .
what about the other alternatives ?
you could use your wireless right here in our lobby .
yes , that is the ticket ! and if i need to print something there ?
well , we do not have a printer in the lobby yet . you will have to use the lab .
i had like to get busy on my computer , but i need some broadband .
there is an ethernet cable in your room . just plug it into the back of your laptop .
i can not use ethernet . my computer is wireless only .
that is okay . i can tell you about some alternatives we have .
any alternative that works will be great .
well , there is our computer lab on the first floor .
that sounds good . what is the charge ?
the lab and the computers are no charge , but you have to pay for whatever you print .
that sounds good . now , how about the other alternatives ?
of course . our lobby is set up for wireless , so just bring your computer down here .
use my laptop in the lobby ? that is great ! now , if i need to print something there ?
they plan to install a printer here . but until then , you will have to use the lab .
i can not get going on my computer until i get a broadband hookup .
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer , and you will be off and running .
that would be okay if i had an ethernet port . unfortunately , my laptop uses wireless only .
in that case , let me tell you about some alternatives .
anything to get me up and running .
for starters , we have a computer lab .
fantastic ! what do i have to pay per hour ?
the lab is completely free . but you do have to pay a dime a page for printing .
that is fine . now tell me about the other alternatives .
just bring your laptop down here to the lobby . we are set up for wireless right here .
great ! i like that suggestion , but what if i need to print something there ?
unfortunately , you will have to go to the computer lab for your printing needs .
how do i get online with my laptop ?
just plug the ethernet cable into your computer , and you will be online in a heartbeat .
i see the cable . but my computer runs on wireless only .
no problem . i will tell you about our alternatives .
yes , i had love to hear what the alternatives are .
our state of the art computer lab is on the first floor .
great ! but is it free ?
sir , the computers are free to guests , but you do have to pay a nominal printing fee .
you said there were other alternatives ?
just use your computer here in the lobby . it is set up for wireless .
that sounds like a winner . now if i need to print something in the lobby ?
we might have a printer here next month . but for now , you will have to go to the lab .
i had like to order a restock on my minibar .

yes , one last thing
i could use some grape juice .
your order will be brought to you momentarily , sir .
is there a swimming pool in this hotel ?
we do not have a full sized swimming pool , but we do have individual swim stations .
what exactly does that mean ?
basically , a swim station is like a treadmill , except instead of running , you swim .
that sounds really neat . is there an extra charge for these swim stations ?
if you are a registered guest , you have free access to our swim stations .
are the swim stations open 24 hours , like the rest of the gym ?
to conserve electricity , the stations operate only from 7 .00 a .m . till 10 .00 p .m .
i will go down there as soon as i can !
i do not think you will be disappointed . people really seem to like the swim stations .
does this hotel have a pool ?
i am sorry , sir , we do not have one . however , in our gym , we do have swim stations .
i am not sure i understand .
think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in , but against a current .
cool . what will they think of next ? how much are they ?
sir , guests pay nothing to use the stations .
excellent ! now what are the hours ?
the gym is open 24/7 , but the stations are open from 7 a .m . to 10 p .m . only .
i am going to change into my trunks right now !
i think you will like the experience , sir . it is a great workout .
do you have a swimming pool in this hotel ?
we do not have a pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in the gym .
i never heard of a swim station . is that like a train or bus station ?
it is just a deep bathtub with a current of water that you swim against .
holy cow ! i never heard of such a thing . how much do they cost ?
as a guest , sir , you pay nothing .
this sounds better every second . now , when can i use the stations ?
if you want to swim , you can visit the gym any day between 7 a .m . and 10 p .m .
oh , boy ! this is going to be great . i am going to the gym right now !
i am sure you will enjoy your workout , sir . everyone seems to like the swim stations .
i think i have looked everywhere , but i have not seen a swimming pool here .
this hotel has no full size pool , but we do have swim stations in our gym .
swim stations ? whoever heard of such a thing ?
you swim in a swim station just like you run on a treadmill .
all that exercise in a little pool ! do i have to pay anything ?
the swim stations are available to all guests for no charge .
very good . now can you tell me the hours of operation ?
they are available anytime between 7 a .m . and 10 p .m , seven days a week .
wow ! i can not wait to change into my trunks !
the swim stations are very popular , sir . i hope you do not find a line down there .
i have been looking for a swimming pool , but i have not found one yet .
we have no pool , sir , but we do have swim stations in our gym .
swim stations ? could you be a little more explicit ?
you know how you run on a treadmill but do not go anywhere ? well , it is the same thing .
gee , that is a great idea . now , how much do i have to pay ?
the stations are absolutely free to guests , sir .
great ! now , when can i go down there and use the stations ?
the swim stations are open daily from 7 a .m . to 10 p .m .
boy , oh boy ! i can not wait to change into my swim trunks .
be warned , sir . at certain hours the swim stations are very crowded .
i need to get a taxi .
we have a variety of transportation services . would you prefer a private vehicle to a taxi ?
no , that will not be necessary . i just need a taxi .
perhaps you had prefer a limousine . that is such a stylish way to travel .
just a taxi , please .
and what is your destination ?
i am going to rockefeller center .
i see . what time do you want to depart from the hotel ?
i want to leave as soon as possible .
okay , a taxi will arrive in seconds , sir .
thank you , i am coming down now .
it will not be but a few seconds , sir .
i need a taxi , please .
we have various transportation services . would you prefer a private vehicle ?
no , thanks . a taxi is just fine .
may i suggest a limo ? it is nice to pamper yourself once in a while .
i do not want anything except a taxi , thank you .
i understand . and where will you be going ?
rockefeller center .
and what time would you like to be picked up ?
the sooner the better .
a taxi will be here shortly , sir .
great ! and remember , a taxi , not a limo .
a taxi it is , sir .
can you get me a taxi ?
we offer various types of transportation . perhaps you had like to upgrade to a private vehicle ?
thanks , but no thanks . a taxi will do just fine .
in that case , how about a limo ? then you can travel in style .
no , i hate limousines . they are gas guzzlers .
got it , sir . where would you like the taxi to take you ?
my destination is rockefeller center .
what time do you want to leave the hotel ?
as soon as possible .
i will call the taxi immediately , sir .
i am coming downstairs now .
a brand new taxi is pulling up now , sir .
i am going to need a taxi .
you do not have to restrict yourself to a taxi . we can offer you a private vehicle .
a private vehicle , huh ? no , a taxi is okay .
some people find a limo to be much more comfortable than a taxi .
no , i would not be caught dead in a limo .
no upgrade of any kind . and where might you be going ?
i am headed to rockefeller center .
when shall i tell the taxi to be here ?
right now .
the taxi will be here immediately , sir .
good , i am leaving my room in about one minute .
you will not have to wait a second , sir .
i need a taxi .

i am seeing a show at rockefeller center .
what time should the taxi be here to pick you up ?
i am ready to go right now .
i will have a taxi for you momentarily , sir .

you will enjoy our new , clean taxis , sir .
could you please reserve a taxi for me ?
do you think a private vehicle might be more to your liking ?
a private vehicle ? no , thanks , i will not need one .

t a x i , please .
a taxi it is . where will you be headed ?
rockefeller center . can you get the taxi here immediately , please ?
a taxi will be here in just a minute , sir .

if you do not mind me asking , how did you enjoy your stay at new york hotel ?
this hotel could use some insecticide , but my time in new york was thoroughly delightful .
that is very honest of you . rest assured that this hotel will have no insects next time .
i want to check out . here is my room key .
one second , sir , while i print out your receipt . here you are .
thanks .
may i ask , sir , if you enjoyed your stay ?

i am leaving . here is my key .
just one second , sir , and i will give you your receipt . here you go .
thank you very much .

i am out of here . here is my key .
give me just a few seconds , sir , and i will hand you your receipt . here you are .
i thank you .
i hope you enjoyed your stay , sir .
i only had nine little problems here . other than that , i enjoyed my stay , and i loved the city .
i apologize again for the cockroaches , sir . i hope you have a nice trip home .
my stay is over . here is the key to my room .
thank you . and here is your receipt , sir .
many thanks .
i hope your stay here was satisfactory , sir .
this could be a great hotel , once you get rid of the insects . the city itself is great .
i am glad that the little problem did not ruin your visit . please have a pleasant trip home .
this visit is over for me . here is your room key .
thank you for that , and in return , here is your receipt .
and thanks to you .
i hope you will visit us again , sir .
i had be willing to try this hotel again , if you can promise me no more cockroaches .
i guarantee you that our little “friends” will not be back . i hope your trip home is pleasant .
my amenities bill says that i owe $10 for a movie , but i never ordered one .
let is see . it says that you were charged monday at 9 .00 p .m . for the movie  titanic . 
that is absolutely wrong ! i was out exploring the city monday night .
okay , let me see what i can do .
thank you . i did not think it would be this simple .
i can take the $10 off your bill , but i need to charge you $2 for the service .
are you serious ? i have to pay $2 for a movie i never watched ?
unfortunately , sir , it is how the computer is programmed .
this is outrageous ! i am never coming back to this hotel again !
i am sorry , sir . perhaps you had like to write a letter to headquarters .
i just discovered that i owe $10 for a movie that i never ordered .
let me check , sir . you were charged for watching  titanic  monday night .
that is absolutely incorrect ! i was out on the town monday night .
okay , sir , bear with me a moment .
thank you for taking my word over the computer is word .
one slight problem , sir . i need to charge you $2 to remove this error from your file .
you can not be serious . you are making me pay $2 for a movie i never watched ?
i feel your pain , sir .
absolutely unbelievable ! you people should be ashamed of yourselves .
i agree with you , sir , but all i do is work here .
you guys are charging me $10 for a movie that i never ordered or saw .
let is see , sir . according to your file , you watched  titanic  monday evening .
the wrong information is in my file . i was at a concert monday night .
well , your word overrules the file , sir . one moment , please .
i knew you had see it my way .
sir , i deleted the $10 , but i had to add a $2 service charge to your bill .
am i in the twilight zone ? you are charging me for a movie i never saw ?
please do not blame me , sir . blame the computer programmer .
this is highway robbery . i have got a good mind to call the police !
if it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way .
why am i being charged $10 for a movie that i never ordered ?
sir , according to your file , you spent monday evening watching  titanic . 
the file is wrong . i was at a great concert that night .
well , this would not be the first time that a file was wrong . just a moment , please .
thank you for taking care of it so quickly .
sir , when i deleted the $10 , the program automatically added a $2 service charge .
you can not do that ! you can not charge me for a mistake that you made !
sometimes you can not win for losing , sir .
now i have seen it all ! what a rip off this place is !
i do not blame you , sir . two dollars is a lot of money .
i need to know why i am being charged $10 for a movie that i never ordered .
hmm . your file shows that you watched  titanic  monday night .
monday night ? monday night i was at a great concert .
well , as they say , garbage in , garbage out . let me correct this error , please .
thank you . it is very nice when problems can be solved quickly .
when i deleted the $10 , the computer automatically added a $2 service charge .
are you crazy ? you made the mistake and now you are charging me for your mistake ?
sir , if it makes you feel any better , the $2 service fee used to be $5 .
why do not you just stick a gun in my ribs and take everything i have ?
unfortunately , sir , you will have to pay the $2 , whether you like it or not .
i am checking out in about half an hour .
whenever you are ready to check out , i will be ready , sir .
great ! as you know however , the day in new york has hardly begun .
you are right . it is only 9 .00 a .m .
therefore , i think i will explore new york some more . but i need to store my bags .
sir , our storage facility is merely $5 an hour . you also need to leave a deposit .
my luggage is not enough of a deposit ?
unfortunately , it is not . visa or mastercard will suffice , though .
let me put on my thinking cap for a moment .
better hurry , sir . remember you have to check out in less than half an hour .
i should tell you that i am checking out in about 30 minutes .
i am ready when you are , sir .
very good ! now , it is still morning here in new york .
you are so right , sir . the clock just struck nine .
i am going to spend some time exploring the city . what can i do with my luggage ?
sir , right here we have a storage site . its only $5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit .
a deposit ? is not my luggage a deposit ?
i am sorry , sir , but it is not . your mastercard or visa will take care of things nicely .
let me think about this .
okay , sir . but do not take too long . you only have 30 minutes .
do you know that i am checking out in about 30 minutes ?
just say the word , sir .
excellent ! now , as you know , the day has barely begun .
i agree . the dew is still on the grass .
i want to hit a few more places in the city , but i need a place to put my luggage .
we do have a storage space for your bags . there is a small charge , plus a deposit .
leave a deposit ? is not leaving the luggage enough of a deposit ?
regrettably , no . but simply present your visa to cover your deposit .
i will have to think about this for a second .
okay , sir , but do not think too long . your checkout is only 30 minutes away .
in case you did not know , i am checking out in half an hour .
that will not be a problem , sir .
that is good to hear . now there is still a whole new york day ahead of me .
you are right , sir . your whole day is still ahead of you .
i still have time to explore more of new york , but i need a place to secure my baggage .
we have a storage place here , but you have to leave a deposit .
a deposit , huh ? i would think my baggage would be enough of a deposit .
just present your visa card , and there will not be any problems .
that deposit bothers me . give me a minute .
okay , sir , but remember how close it is to your checkout time .
i will be checking out of the hotel in about 30 minutes .
thirty minutes or 30 seconds , sir , it does not matter , i am ready for you .
great ! as you know , however , the day in new york has hardly begun .
there is nothing like getting an early start , sir .
what can i do with my baggage while i visit a few more tourist spots ?
you can leave your baggage in our storage space , with a deposit .
is not my baggage enough of a deposit ?
i wish it was , but it is not . they will still want a credit card .
it is always something , is not it ? let me think about this for a second .
do not forget that you have very little time , sir , before you have to check out .
i had like to leave a parcel for one of my friends . is that okay ?
all i need is your name , the name of your friend , and the time of pick up .
all of that is on the package . can i just bring it down to your desk ?
that would be most convenient for me . thanks for your consideration !
i want to leave a parcel for a friend to pick up . can i do that ?
just tell me your name , your friend is name , and when your friend is coming by .
i will put all that information on the package and just bring it down to you . is that okay ?
