Use spacy initially and later switch to Stanford's CoreNLP Library for more accuracy
Intent Recognition-
	-Rasa_nlu
	-Machine Learning- Nearest Neighbour from word vector
Named Entity Recognition- Not much useful as of now in practice
Remove stopwords before making word vectors for cosine similarity(nltk library)
